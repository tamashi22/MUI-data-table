# MUI Data Table Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of Material-UI (MUI) components, particularly the DataGrid component, to create a dynamic and interactive data table in a React application. The table includes sorting, filtering, with additional functionalities like image modals and product detail modals. The state of the table (sorting, filtering) persists across page reloads, and users can toggle between light and dark themes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Vite:** As the build tool and development server.
- **Material-UI (MUI):** For UI components and theming.
- **Day.js:** For date formatting.
- **Swiper:** For the image carousel in the product detail modal.
- **Axios:** For fetching data from an API.
